The solution is to always use parentheses around complex expressions within the ternary operator to explicitly define the order of evaluation:

```php
$value1 = 10;
$value2 = 5;
$value3 = 2;
$value4 = 4;
$value5 = 6;
$condition = true;

// Incorrect - likely not what you intend
$resultIncorrect = $condition ? $value1 + $value2 && $value3 : $value4 || $value5;

// Correct - use parentheses to enforce intended order of operations
$resultCorrect = $condition ? ($value1 + $value2 && $value3) : ($value4 || $value5);

echo "Incorrect Result: " . $resultIncorrect . "\n";
echo "Correct Result: " . $resultCorrect . "\n";
```

By enclosing `$value1 + $value2 && $value3` and `$value4 || $value5` in parentheses, we ensure the addition and multiplication happen *before* the logical operations, leading to the expected outcome.
