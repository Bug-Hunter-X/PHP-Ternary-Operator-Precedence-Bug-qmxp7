This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator with complex expressions that lack proper parentheses:

```php
$result = $condition ? $value1 + $value2 : $value3 * $value4;
```

If `$condition` is true, it evaluates `$value1 + $value2`.  If it's false, it evaluates `$value3 * $value4`.  However, if you intend the expressions to be more complex, you need to enclose them in parentheses to ensure the order of operations is correct:

```php
//Incorrect - likely not what you intend
$result = $condition ? $value1 + $value2 && $value3 : $value4 || $value5;

//Correct
$result = $condition ? ($value1 + $value2 && $value3) : ($value4 || $value5);
```

Without parentheses, the boolean AND and OR operations might be performed before the addition and multiplication, leading to unexpected results. This is because the precedence of arithmetic operators is lower than that of the logical operators. The lack of proper parentheses can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors, especially when dealing with more complex expressions.
